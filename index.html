               <h2>Honeymoon in Barcelona</h2>
               <p>My husband AJ visited Barcelona, Spain years ago and fell in love and I fell in love 
                  through his description of the people, places, and food. So when it came time to take 
                  our honeymoon, there was no doubting where we wanted to go. Even though we were limited 
                  on time due to work, we made the most of the 5 days we were there by fully imerssing 
                  ourselves into the Spanish culture.</p>

               <h2>Walking the Streets</h2>
               <p>My husband visited Barcelona in the past, so he suggested several landmarks to visit. 
                  We decided to see most on foot. We saw the most beautiful architecture I've ever seen.</p>

               <h2>La Sagrada Familia</h2>
               <p>One of the most moving places we visited on our trip to Barcelona was to La Sagrada Familia. 
                  I was in complete awe at the amount of detail inside this gorgeous structure. 
                  This church's construction began in the late eighteen hundreds and is still actively under construction. 
                  I high recommend a visit for yourself!</p>

               <h2>Shopping</h2>
               <p>We enjoyed going into small artisan owned shops. It was very interesting to see the artist performing their craft 
                  in front of you. AJ and I both left with some handmade goods, a leather belt for him and beautiful ring for me!</p>

               <h2>Flamenco</h2>
               <p>We enjoyed a Flamenco show while on our trip. I was so impressed by the passion and skill of these dancers.</p>

               <p>I love to be by the water and this was my first time to see the Mediterranean Sea and what a sight it was. 
                  Even though we were there during the winter, we were able to spend some time sea side since our hotel was 
                  right on the beach.

               <h2>We Came, We Saw, We ATE GOOD FOOD.</h2>
               <p>I loved everything about our trip, the people, the architecture, the history, but my absolute favorite 
                  part about our trip was the food! We had coffee and crossants, ate fresh meat, cheese, and bread from 
                  the market on the beach, stumbled upon a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant that only sat about 10 people 
                  and ate some of the best food I had ever eaten. We also discovered Paella! I was new to this type of food, 
                  but it's become a staple in our meals at home.</p>
